## Introduction

The MNIST dataset is widely used in the machine learning community for digit recognition tasks. In this project, we implement a CNN-based image classification model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The key steps include data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:
```shell
pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Aayushi-4094/H.D.R.CNN
   cd mnist-image-classification
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook.

3. Follow the code comments for explanations of each step.

4. You can modify the model architecture or hyperparameters to experiment with different configurations.

5. After training, the model's accuracy on the test set will be displayed.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `Handwritten Digit.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
